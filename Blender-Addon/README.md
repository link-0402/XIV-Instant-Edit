# XIV Instant Edit

XIV Instant Edit is a focused Blender extension for the XIV Instant Edit Dalamud
plugin. It contains only the model I/O and scene tools needed for the bridge,
plus a standalone Simple Import/Export panel.

## Features

- Receives secure, versioned `.mdl` import requests from XIV Instant Edit.
- Creates isolated import collections and preserves the authorized Penumbra
  export destination.
- Supports generated import armatures or a named existing scene armature.
- Displays and assigns the FFXIV material path for every visible mesh group.
- Highlights only the mesh-part rows whose normalized export material is
  missing or differs from the first part used by their mesh group.
- Optionally builds import-local, packed Principled BSDF previews from the
  effective game/Penumbra MTRL and TEX resources supplied by the plugin.
- Supports adding new visible mesh parts and groups anywhere in the scene using
  YAA-compatible `group.part Name` object names.
- Includes a Toolbox action to convert suffix-form mesh IDs from Textools/FBX
  scenes into the prefix naming convention.
- Combines two armatures into a new rest rig through **Toolbox > Combine
  Armatures**. Choose the base rig and an additional rig; shared bone names use
  the base definition. Both originals are kept and hidden in the current view
  layer, and only visible meshes using them are reassigned. Existing vertex
  groups and weights stay unchanged; create groups for newly available bones
  as needed. Pose, animation, and rig controls remain on the originals. Undo
  restores the original visibility and mesh bindings.
- Quick Export back to the original source mod, including variants and optional
  Penumbra setup.
- Saves a single-context export as a new Penumbra mod, bundling material and
  texture files owned by participating mods.
- Creates multi-context mashups as a new group in the active mod or as a new
  Penumbra mod. The creation popup can optionally bundle eligible materials and
  textures from non-participating mods. Vanilla resources and shared body/skin,
  pube, and piercing materials remain pass-through dependencies; any remaining
  required external mods are listed in the result and mod description.
- Offsets incoming MDL mesh-group IDs away from visible conflicts without
  changing group assignment based on materials.
- Persists import authorization in the Dalamud plugin and reconnects saved scene
  contexts after Blender or plugin restarts.
- Recovers export receipts after network timeouts without submitting a second
  write, and durably queues context revocations while the plugin is offline.
- Redraws the local player and their currently spawned summons, minions, and
  mounts after Quick Export.
- Simple Export to MDL, FBX, or glTF for visible mesh objects, with an explicit
  `All except...` mesh exclusion option.
- Simple Import from MDL, FBX, or glTF (.gltf/.glb) files.
- Simple Import/Export settings are separated into dedicated option sections,
  including the import-time export-folder setting.
- Export-time UV2 copy/clear, vertex color/alpha cleanup, and flow-data cleanup.
- Optional **Reset Scaling on Export** neutralization; armature rest-pose
  neutralization and complete state restoration remain automatic.

Meshes in one export may resolve to different Blender armatures. Each mesh uses
its parent armature when present, otherwise its first valid Armature modifier.
Every resolved rig is evaluated in rest pose. The resulting FFXIV MDL merges the
used bone names into one bone list; it does not preserve separate Blender
armature identities.

Material previews are display-only and intentionally approximate. They do not
include actor colors or dye baking, do not add material/texture editing, and
are never included in Quick Export. Missing preview resources fall back to the
existing colored placeholder without blocking geometry import. Gear using
`character.shpk`-family colorsets and index textures is composed into a packed
base-color preview. Standalone
Simple Import does not resolve FFXIV resources and is unchanged.

When the Dalamud **Exclude body and general materials** sub-option is enabled,
body skin, body-piercing, and pube slots intentionally retain their colored
placeholders without producing missing-preview warnings.

## Installation

Build or install the extension ZIP through Blender's Extensions preferences.
The source directory itself can also be used for development with Blender 4.5.0
or newer.

Do not enable this extension at the same time as a custom Yet Another Addon
build that also contains the XIV Instant Edit listener. Both would attempt to own
the same local port (42424 by default). The unmodified upstream Yet Another
Addon can coexist because it does not provide that listener.

The connection ports can be changed in the extension preferences. The cache
directory and automatic cleanup are configured in the in-game plugin settings.
Simple Export and XIV Instant Edit controls are in the **XIV Instant Edit** sidebar
tab of the 3D Viewport.
